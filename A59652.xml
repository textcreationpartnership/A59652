            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Beſides this Retribution which I was in Juſtice to make, if I would be <hi>Modiſh,</hi> I ſhould go on to take notice of your other Vertues. For Books are more commonly without <hi>Epiſtles De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory,</hi> then thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> without an <hi>Elogy</hi> of the perſons to whom they are made. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Sir,</hi> you deſerve it, and the Argument I proſecute would fairly lead me to it: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if I ſhould ſay little, I ſhould detract from your worth: For as he who with all ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pretended Faithfulneſs reproves another for ſome petty
<pb facs="tcp:105389:4"/> eſcapes and inadvertencies of life, would have it believed that there are no greater faults to come under Cenſure: (a note whereby <hi>Plutarch</hi> diſtinguiſhes<note place="margin">De adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimine.</note> a <hi>Flatterer</hi> from a <hi>Friend.</hi>) So will he who ſlightly and ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends, give occaſion to ſuſpect, that there is nothing elſe worthy of commendation. But if on the other ſide, I ſhould be as large, as Applications of this nature uſe to be, and as your <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> juſtly <hi>Challengeth;</hi> They who are ſtrangers to your <hi>Perſon,</hi> would not believe but I were a <hi>Flatterer:</hi> A Vice ſo abhorrent to my Nature, (unleſs I flatter my ſelf) that I think I have ſometimes been too <hi>Moroſe,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:105389:4"/> have been wanting to give Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>Value</hi> I have had for many perſons, upon no other account, but becauſe I would not be thought to <hi>Flatter.</hi> To avoid which ſuſpition, I now ſay the leſs; yet I do not doubt, but my thoughts of <hi>you,</hi> and all other <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> are as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> as theirs who comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and brag more.</p>
            <p>Such there are in the world, bafely Mercenary <hi>Paraſites, who have Mens perſons in admiration but for their own advantage;</hi> who under pretence of Honouring Vertue, do it a great deal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice; for while they commend Men as if they were Vertuous, and that at all adventures; they
<pb facs="tcp:105389:5"/> encourage many to be ſtill <hi>Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> And yet there is ſome good comes out of this evil; for when they who do not deſerve it are flattered and ſpoken well of, it is a great Argument that Vertue is very Excellent and Praiſe-worthy where indeed it is: for why ſhould a Picture be drawn hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer then the Face, but becauſe Beauty is a deſirable thing? This is ſome advantage, in as much as it is a conviction to the world, that, that Vertue which is ſo much commended, ought to be more practiſed: Elſe it is as true here as any where—<hi>Laudatur &amp; Alget.</hi>

Theſe men have not their deſerts, if they be not <hi>men</hi> of <hi>renown,</hi> and <hi>famous</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:105389:8"/> their generations. This I have ſaid, that I might not be thought to derogate from them, nor by any thing that follows, <hi>eclipſe</hi> or <hi>darken</hi> the <hi>ſplendour</hi> of their names.</p>
            <p>For notwithſtanding all this, though <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Controverſy</hi> be very excellent in their kind: yet <hi>Practical Books</hi> do more nearly concern us, than many <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſial:</hi> Thoſe <hi>diſputes</hi> are moſt <hi>excellent</hi> that are moſt <hi>uſeful;</hi> and then are they of greateſt uſe, when they inform the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to the directing and better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life; from which end, thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which are more remote, have leaſt of excellency, and may beſt be ſpared. But <hi>Books of Practice</hi> are therefore ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe they do immediately tend to the bettering the lives of men. There are many things concerning which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies are moved, which we may ſafely be ignorant of; There are others which it is fit we ſhould have a right underſtanding in; yet if we doubt, or it may be are in Errour, it is ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage as holy men may be obnoxious to, and yet continue holy. But there are not ſo great allowances given us in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of practice, as that we may count our ſelves unconcerned in them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105389:8"/>
            <p>Beſides, it is not for every one to write, nor for every one to read Books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: we whoſe employments fix us in obſcure corners of the Country, far from <hi>Books,</hi> but what our own poor <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries</hi> furniſh us withall, and far from frequent converſe with <hi>Learned men,</hi> it cannot be expected that we ſhould man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage diſputes equally with thoſe who have better helps; or if we ſhould, what little notice would the greateſt part of our people take of them; they who little underſtand, would as little regard theſe things? But every <hi>Body</hi> hath a <hi>Soul</hi> to ſave, and is therefore obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the way that leads to that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more than ſo, to walk in it. So that there is a peculiar excellency in thoſe writings that teach us how to <hi>order our converſations aright,</hi> which is not in many ſpeculations and parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Archimedes</hi> did well to ſtudy the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and the skill he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Noble Science was ſo great, that few mens inventions did better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But when the <hi>City</hi> was taken, and his life in danger, it had been better for him if he had more ſtudied his own preſervation. So they who retch
<pb facs="tcp:105389:9"/> their faculties as far as they can, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the comprehenſion of <hi>Omne ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> do well, provided that they do not in the mean time neglect that which is more neceſſary, the ſtudy of a good life.</p>
            <p>To promote which, is the deſign of this Book; a deſign certainly good, for it aims to make men good. What I have done in it is not for me to ſay; ſure I am, I have meant honeſtly, and have faithfully endeavoured. If any wonder why I ſpend ſo many words in ſo an acknowledged an Argument (as if a man ſhould write a Book to prove, that ſo long as the Sun ſhines the day laſts) the firſt part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wickedneſs and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is very bold, and bare-faced, and it is no eaſy matter to put it out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: yea in all likelihood, where Immorality diſcovers it ſelf ſo ſhameleſs in the life, there is <hi>Atheiſme</hi> ſetled at the heart.

               <p>It remains therefore to make good the ſecond part of the charge, that they have failed not onely in the matter but manner too.

In the mean time ſome of them poſſibly, ſcarſe believe themſelves Reaſonable Creatures, and then it will be in vain to argue with them; if they pretend to Reaſon, I will endeavour to ſpeak pertinently to the caſe, by producing Arguments of ſeveral ſorts, to prove it neceſſary for them, and all the reſt of mankind, to he good and Vertuous, and preſuming upon the ſtrength of them (to which I am now approaching) I may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſay, that theſe evill imaginations of men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105389:33"/> of corrupt minds, add no more diſadvantage to the Cauſe, then any thing that was before pleaded: Wherefore I conclude this firſt part of my diſcourſe, and I hope I have prooved my firſt general Propoſition, which was this; whatever Reaſons may have induced ſome men to ſpeak ſlightly of Morality, yet none of them all conclude, that it is not neceſſary for a Chriſtian to be a Moral man.</p>

The caſe is the ſame in Revenge; he that will not forgive an Injury, yet will be glad to be forgiven when his Enemy hath an advantage againſt him: He that will not feed the Poor,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Vertue is much for the worlds advantage, for it is a firm and ſolid foundation for true friendſhip. There is no friendſhip we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in any farther, than we can have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the reaſon and cauſe of that friendſhip doth remain and abide; therefore when either proſperity or adverſity, or meer Neighbourhood of place or intereſt (as all theſe do) make men friends; this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain friendſhip, becauſe the foundation is uncertain. Where proſperity makes friends, if one be falling into adverſity, the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes him, like Rats and Mice that run away when the Houſe is falling: So did the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

Again, two men whom the Priſon hath reconciled, preferment hath ſevered and diſtanced from one another.

If Vertue be not in the caſe, we are at a loſs for a firm Baſis to found friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip<note place="margin">Cicer. Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</note> on. <hi>Hoc ſentio niſi in bonis amicitiam eſſe poſſe;</hi> for why ſhould I make that man my Friend, whom I cannot truſt? how can I truſt a man, unleſs I believe him to be an honeſt and juſt man? Again a proud man is unfit for a friend: there is a kind of equality among friends (not of ſtate and condition, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers would introduce, but) the humility and condeſcenſions of the Superiour, will meet with his friend, and in the ſimpathy of their Souls there is a likeneſs and an oneneſs. Pride therefore makes men unſociable, ſo doth Anger and quarrelſomeneſs, and ſuch like evil diſpoſitions. Still therefore we want that which cements friends together, and we ſhall not find it till we come to Vertue: that is a thing to be confided in. Not that I would make every man my friend, whom in charity I ought to judge honeſt as to the main (as we uſe to ſay) for there are many ſuch men, who are yet guilty of many unhappy failings and weakneſſes. Every one is not fit to keep a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and it is not ſafe to unboſome our Souls
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105389:93"/> to them. Some are cenſorious (a diſtemper that ſpreads very far this day in <hi>England</hi>) and other things there are that make men leſs apt for theſe purpoſes: but then it is to be obſerved, all this is want of thoſe degrees of Vertue which we ought to aſpire to; ſtill therefore ſo far as men are vertuous they have the right diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for friends; for hereby men are taught to perform all good Offices for their friend that they are able (as hath been lately ſaid, Vertue ſets men on work to do good) and alſo it doth reſtrain men from doing thoſe that are not good. There is a kind of obſtinate friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which many times proceeds to a Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in iniquity: Men are ſo reſolved to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and gratifie their friend, that they will do evil for their ſakes. So was <hi>C. Bloſſius</hi> to<note place="margin">Cicer. Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</note> 
                  <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> he was ſo much his friend, he ſaid, that he would do any thing for him; and when the queſtion was asked, what if <hi>Gracchus</hi> ſhould bid you fire the <hi>Capitol,</hi> would you do it? he anſwers he would not bid me do ſuch a thing; but if he ſhould, I would do as he bid me. So had <hi>Herod</hi> paſſed his word<note place="margin">Math. 14</note> and his Oath to the Daughter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> to do for her whatſoever ſhe ſhould ask; and when ſhe required the head of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> he would not deny it to her. Now here is an excellent uſe of Vertue, to keep friendſhip within its right Channel. A Vertuous man will do all the good he can to his friend, but (unleſs he fail in his Vertue) he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane that ſacred thing, by entring into a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105389:94"/> League to maintain friendſhip, whether by lawful or unlawful means. Now true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a noble and gallant thing, an excellent attainment of humane Nature; but that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Complements have almoſt either obſcured it where it is, or crowded, it into ſome few corners of the World, that it is ſcarce any where to be found. Surely civility, and affability, and courteſie, is a fine accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; yet I am of opinion (and though I be accounted a Clown for ſo thinking, I am not much ſollicitous) that as <hi>Sarah</hi> turned <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> out of doors for her fcornful Imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo if ever friendſhip get any conſiderable dominion in the World, ſmcerity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs muſt keep ſomewhat a ſtricter hand over diſſembling Complements. I fear men muſt grow leſs Complemental, if they would approve themſelves real friends; but I am going out of the way: I could not chuſe but ſalute friendſhip when it came in my way; I return and make this uſe of this ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: If friendſhip be ſuch an excellent thing, then is this greatly to the commendation of Vertue, that it doth ſo help to make and keep men friends. Which is the laſt inſtance I give (and I cannot conclude with a better) that it is much for the profit and advantage of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that men ſhould live in the exerciſe of Moral Vertues.

I am now towards my Concluſion, only I remember I did promiſe ſomewhat by way of appendix to adde to this laſt conſideration; That as there is a neceſſity of Moral Vertue, ſo likewiſe is there an excellency in it: and this will require
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105389:95"/> a few words; but I will not multiply many.</p>
               <p>Vertue is not only neceſſary, but it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, brave, becoming thing, a thing lovely and of good report: It cannot otherwiſe be, if that be true which is already ſaid; that which is ſo good and comfortable to our ſelves, ſo good and advantagious to others, if we do not admire it, we do greatly undervalue it; we do not well underſtand it, if we do not believe it to be very excellent. So much hath been ſaid to thoſe heads, that I am loth again to refer to them: Any one may eaſily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the force of an Argument, that which hath the qualifications before-mentioned, is very Excellent: wherefore paſſing that by, I adde two things more: There is a great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Moral Vertue, for it is an imitation of God, and a Type of Heaven. Both which muſt be underſtood with ſome caution.</p>

It is true, we call God holy and not vertuous, for the holineſs of God is not to be deſcribed after the ſame manner that we define Moral Vertue. Our paſſions are the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the matter that our vertue works upon, which paſſions are not aſſignable to God: And there are ſome particular vertues which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attribute to God; as Temperance, which ſuppoſes us in a bodily ſtate, and Humility, which at beſt ſuppoſes us in a creature-ſtate (for though it pleaſes God in Scripture to ſay he humbles himſelf, yet that doth no more prove that he is humble in our notion, then his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105389:96"/> proves that he doth repent as we do) yet notwithſtanding by vertue we reſemble God. The holineſs of God is the perfection and rectitude of his Nature; ſo our vertue, though alone it be not our perfection, yet it belongs to our integrity and rectitude: When we are commanded to <hi>be holy, in all manner of Converſation,</hi> how can we fulfil that Command, if we do not exerciſe thoſe vertues without which our Converſation cannot be as it ought to be?

The Heathens had the ſame apprehenſions of their Vertues; though they fel ſhort of the attainment,

And is not this a great ennoblement of our ſouls, that we may be raiſed up to be like God? doth not God infinitely excel all his creatures? wherefore though we come infinitely ſhort of the divine perfections, yet ſo far as we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any reſemblance of him, it is our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to be like that God, who doth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely excel. To be transformed into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Creatour, what can be more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? yea, may we not ſay, (if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that which yet cannot poſſibly come to paſs) that if it were poſſible for holineſs and happineſs to be ſeparated from one another, it were a greater perfection and glory to be like God in holineſs then in happineſs. The ſtate of happineſs in Heaven we call a glorious ſtate, and it is a greater glory then we can now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: But is not holineſs more glorious? if unholineſs be worſe then unhappineſs, then is holineſs better then happineſs: now ſo it is; for unhappineſs is our miſery, but unholineſs is our ſin, and therefore more to be avoided. Where are now the men that dare ſit in <hi>the Seat of the Scorners,</hi> to deſpiſe and laugh at all manner of Goodneſs and Vertue? is it nothing to be like God? ſhould we chuſe to be like the Devil in Malice and Revenge, and ill will, and ſuch like evil diſpoſitions, is it a thing to be gloried in? is there any will glory that he is going to Hell to keep company with the Devils? ſurely we do not underſtand our Natures, or we cannot
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105389:97"/> but acknowledge, it is a great excellency to be like God, as we are, in the exerciſe of theſe Moral Vertues. To which might be added as a conſideration contiguous to this; the life of Chriſt doth greatly commend Moral Vertue: He was Temperate, and Meek, and Humble, <hi>he went about doing good;</hi> and many proofs in the Goſpel there are, that in all his dealings with all men he behav'd himſelf as did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him; which may help to confirm us in a belief of the excellency of Vertue; it is ſuch an imitation of God, as the life of Chriſt was very remarkable for.

                  <hi>and at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Yet as it is an acceſſory to their glory to be in company with one another; ſo is this ſomewhat not to be deſpiſed, that their love is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and all the correſpondencies of Heaven are ſinleſs and pure: Hell ſhall be ſhut up in Hell, all Deviliſh qualities ſhall be baniſhed Heaven, and Holineſs and Righteouſneſs will be in its Triumphancy in that Church Triumphant. Now if this be the utmoſt perfection of which our natures are capable, to be tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſtate; how muſt it needs be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attainment, to be in any meaſure like thoſe glorified ſpirits? There is ſomewhat in our natures, that doth mind us of an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in every ſtate and attainment in this world; for it is natural for us to deſire a change: There are the ſtrivings of the Infant in the womb, which diſcover the inclinations of its nature to be born into the world, and to be at liberty: Boys would fain be Men, and Men notwithſtanding that they deſpiſe Old Age in others, yet would live to be old themſelves: an Apprentice would be out of his time, to ſet up for himſelf; and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath a great deſire to become a Maſter.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105389:98"/> There is ſcarce any thing in the Univerſe, but would be graduate, and commence ſome higher degrees of perfection, then it hath yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. All this would not be, if there were not a belief, an imagination at leaſt, that there is ſome greater excellency in thoſe ſtates, to which we are not yet arrived, then for the preſent we do enjoy: wherefore if ever we deſire after Heaven, while we are upon Earth, (as we ought always to do) this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes we believe it to be a place of more glorious excellencies, then any we have yet ſeen or taſted now in this world; and if it be ſo, then we muſt go on to argue, that (in regard it is not ſo much the place, as the the ſtate that makes the happineſs) the nearer we come in the diſpoſition of our minds, and the tenour of our lives, to that Heavenly ſtate, our lives are ſo much the more excellent. And this being true of a Vertuous and good life, that it is ſome reſemblance to, and ſome weaker degrees of the life of Heaven; it adds to the Argument, that as there is a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of, ſo there is a ſuperlative excellency in Moral Vertue.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Here is Apology enough for thoſe Preachers of the Goſpel, who Preach the Moral Law in Goſpel times; who would put Chriſtians in mind that they are men ſtill, and muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the duties of man to man: It is a Doctrine that we have this only reaſon to be aſham'd of, that we who Preach it to others, do ſo little practiſe it our ſelves; elſe if we ſuffer in our good names for this kind of Preaching, we <hi>ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> and we may<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> well glory in our ſufferings. Where a People have conceived a prejudice againſt their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, there is ſcarce any kind of Preaching, but they will cavil at: If we endeavour to give them ſatisfaction concerning the order and diſcipline of the Church, and tell them what reaſon they have to be peaceable and modeſt, and not to make diviſions; then <hi>we are the men who are all for conformity and the ſervice of the outward man; and if we can but bring our people to conform, we do not care what lives they live.</hi> This we would not be thought to do, to neglect to give our people good inſtructions for their lives; and therefore we inſiſt upon Moral Vertues ſometimes, and would perſwade men to be juſt, and honeſt, and charitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then we are in danger of being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Popiſh: <hi>theſe men ſure hope to be ſaved by their good works, they extol them ſo much, and preach them up ſo often:</hi> No not ſo neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
